### Works Out of the Box

- XBox 360 Wired Controller
- XBox 360 Wireless Controller - You need a [dongle](http://www.amazon.com/Xbox-360-Wireless-Gaming-Receiver-Windows/dp/B000HZFCT2) to use a wireless controller with SteamOS. It recognizes it out of the box, just [pair your controller](https://support.xbox.com/en-ZA/xbox-360/accessories/connecting-game-controllers) with the dongle in the same way you do it on your XBox. SteamOS supports up to four wireless controllers in this manner.
